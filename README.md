<h3>HTML 5 Open Source Data Grid</h3>

This is the datagrid the community has needed for a very a long time. This will be entirely developed from scratch. However there will be a lot of features leveraged from the following datagrids:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://handsontable.com/" target="_blank">Handsontable</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid" target="_blank">Slickgrid</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.2.0-modern/guides/components/grids.html" target="_blank">Sencha ExtJS Datagrid</a></li>
</ul>

The most important aspects of this project are:

<ul>
  <li>Free</li>
  <li>Community Supported and Developed</li>
  <li>Responsive</li>
  <li>Large Data Set Capability</li>
  <li>Unit Testable</li>
  <li>Automated Builds</li>
</ul>

This will be a daunting task just to get version 1.0.0 out of the door and into the market by January 1, 2017. I have faith in the people that I bring aboard this project that we can get this done on-time with the proper checks in place.  Eventually at the end of the day I hope I can walk away and this project continue to evolve into something that the community takes on itself. As a software developer we all have a responsibility to give something to the community. This is my personal gift to the world and I hope that it becomes something that even I cannot imagine.
